## Discord

Here are sometools for discord.

- [The Dice Parser](https://github.com/Rolisteam/DiceParser/blob/master/HelpMe.md#if) tool to roll on discord. Not really useful if you play on roll20 though.

## Virtual table tops

You can play on a virtual table top :

- [Roll 20](https://roll20.net/welcome) which my favorite and most consistent tool.

## Encounters

- [All ennemies from dnd with filters](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/monsters.php): This includes most ennemies from the dnd books. You can miss some of them due to OGL problems but you will have the name and a basic description nonetheless.

- [The encounter builder](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-encounter/index.php): This gives a quick idea on how difficult an encounter is. Usually you can do 3 to 5 difficult encounters per long rest.

- [Fun and simple ideas for taverns brawling](https://www.dndspeak.com/2018/02/10/100-tavern-encounters/)

## Others

- [Any flip downloader](https://github.com/Lofter1/anyflip-downloader): This is used to download pdf from the any flip web site.

# Tools

Here are some useful tools for playing dnd online.

## Maps

- [Feerun large map](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/dnd/resources/Sword-Coast-Map_HighRes.jpg).
- [Some nice town and city maps](https://mikeschley.com/fictional-city-maps)

# Items and prices

- [5e normal item prices](https://www.kassoon.com/dnd/5e/magic-item-prices/): This uses the normal dnd prices based of the item's rarity. This is pretty bad tbh. 
- [5e sane magical prices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8XAiXpOfz9cMWt1RTBicmpmUDg/view?resourcekey=0-ceHUken0_UhQ3Apa6g4SJA): This is a really good and useful tool to price your magical items. Basically, the dnd books are terrible at giving prices that make sense in the world economy of Faerun. This list is much much better than pretty much everything from wizard of the coast. 

## Discord

Here are sometools for discord.

- [The Dice Parser](https://github.com/Rolisteam/DiceParser/blob/master/HelpMe.md#if) tool to roll on discord. Not really useful if you play on roll20 though.

## Virtual table tops

You can play on a virtual table top :

- [Roll 20](https://roll20.net/welcome) which my favorite and most consistent tool.

## Encounters

- [All ennemies from dnd with filters](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/monsters.php): This includes most ennemies from the dnd books. You can miss some of them due to OGL problems but you will have the name and a basic description nonetheless.

- [The encounter builder](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-encounter/index.php): This gives a quick idea on how difficult an encounter is. Usually you can do 3 to 5 difficult encounters per long rest.

- [Fun and simple ideas for taverns brawling](https://www.dndspeak.com/2018/02/10/100-tavern-encounters/)

## Others

- [Any flip downloader](https://github.com/Lofter1/anyflip-downloader): This is used to download pdf from the any flip web site.
